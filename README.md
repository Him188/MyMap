## Q&A

- How to set GIF image?  
  The same way as static images.
- How to set Multi images?  
  Create a folder under plugins/MyMap/images, put images in it.(Needs static picture, dynamic GIF only displays the first frame).  
  Name of picture decides how long to display. (Not included the suffix, explodes by "-", the last one is the display time)  
  Examples:
  - pic-3000.jpg  displays 3000ms = 3s
  - img-500.png  displays 500ms = 0.5s
  - -3000.bmp  displays 3000ms = 3s

  PS: If filename has no or more than 1 "-", or the number is invalid(negative), it will use default display time 3000ms=3s.
